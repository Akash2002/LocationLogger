# LocationLogger
A logging application to help you log your travel to maintain a memorable journal.

Once upon a time, before Covid19, I used to travel a lot with my family, and I thought of how cool it would be to log all the locations that I went to, and I did
just that. Initially, I was going to implement a sensor in the car to connect to my phone so that all the logging is automated, but due to technical difficulties,
I held off on that to make a manual logger.
